Description: The intended use cases for this package occur when dealing with very messy data found "in the wild." Sometimes, one encounters data that has columns that are transposed or in a meaningless order. That is, a value found in row 1 column 1 may have no connection to the value found in row 2 column 1. Often this occurs due to data entry errors, data not intended to be stored in table format, or from user/survey data that has not been properly validated (e.g., a user puts their ZIP code in the state field and their state in their address 2 field, etc.)
